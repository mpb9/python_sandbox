# Python Sandbox

## Set-up :gear:

### Create Environment

1. `mkdir python_sandbox`
2. `cd python_sandbox`
3. `pip install virtualenv`
4. `virtualenv sandbox_env`

### Start/Stop

Start: `source sandbox_env/bin/activate`
Stop: `deactivate`

### Install Packages

#### Via command line

`pip install [package]`

#### Via requirements.txt

1. Create file based on current packages

    `pip freeze > requirements.txt`

2. Add packages to requirements.txt using syntax `PACKAGE_NAME==VERSION_NUMBER`

    ex:

    ```txt
    requests==2.32.3
    scipy==1.14.1
    ...
    ```

3. Add/update packages in virtual environment

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
